# House Price Prediction Project

## Description

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes features such as price, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage of living space, lot size, etc. The prediction model is built using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- TensorFlow

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies. You can install them using pip:


pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn tensorflow



## Usage
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Ensure you have Python and the required dependencies installed.
- Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the code.
- Run the code to train the model and make predictions.

## Code Explanation
- The code imports necessary libraries including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and TensorFlow.
- It loads the dataset containing information about house prices and features.
- The data is preprocessed, including handling missing values and scaling numerical features.
- A neural network model is built using the Sequential API of TensorFlow's Keras module.
- The model is trained using the mean squared error loss function and the Adam optimizer.
- Finally, the model is evaluated and predictions are made.
